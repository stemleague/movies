# Print the list (movies) with the message "Original Movie Collection: " (Type cast the list to a string when concatenating!)


# Print the list (years) with the message "Original Years: " (Type cast the list to a string when concatenating!)


# Print the number of movies in our collection by using the len(list_name) function on the list (movies) with the message "Number of movies: " (Type cast the list to a string when concatenating!)


# Print the number of occurences of the movies "Back to the Future" and "Train to Busan" in (movies) by calling the count(value) function



# Ah! We have 2 duplicate movies in our collection! Call the remove(value) function on the list (movies) to eliminate "Back to the Future" and "Train to Busan" once each from our collection.


# Print (movies) to make sure output does not include duplicate movies


# The movie collection is out of order! We want to sort the movies in order by increasing year. 

# First, call the sort() function on the list (years) to sort them in increasing order. Print out the result to make sure the years are sorted!



# Then, call the insert(index, value) function on the list (movies) to change the movie titles around to match the order of the list (years). Print along the way to test the output!


# Ask the user to enter their favorite movie (hint: input function) and store inside variable called "fave_movie"


# Append variable "fave_movie" to the list (movies) 


# Ask the user to enter the year their favorite movie was released (hint: input function) and store inside variable called "movie_year"


# Append variable "movie_year" to the list (years)


# Call the insert(index, value) function if the new movie and new year are out of order in the lists 



# A customer wants to purchase movies from the years 2000-2020. Use indexing to print the movies from this time period. Can you do this using negative index values?



# After the customer has purchased these titles, we need to remove them from the collection. Call the remove(value) function on these values.



# Print the list (movies) with the message "Sorted Movie Collection: " (Type cast the list to a string when concatenating!)


# Print the list (years) with the message "Sorted Years: " (Type cast the list to a string when concatenating!)
